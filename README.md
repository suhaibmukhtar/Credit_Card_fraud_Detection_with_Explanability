Importation of libraries is one of the beginning steps of the data analysis process in which necessary libraries, packages, classes, etc. are loaded into the Python environment. These libraries provide various functionalities, modules, classes, etc., using which it becomes easier to perform credit card fraud detection and analysis.

The screenshot shown below displays the libraries, modules, and classes that are being used throughout the lifecycle of the project. It includes libraries such as:

- **Numpy**: For performing array and matrix operations.
- **Pandas**: For cleaning and manipulation of data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building and evaluation.
- **GridSearchCV**: For tuning parameters of a machine learning model.
- **SHAP** and **LIME**: For explainability of complex machine learning models.
